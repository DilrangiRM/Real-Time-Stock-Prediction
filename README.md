# ðŸ“ˆ AAPL Stock Price Movement Prediction using MLP, RNN, and LSTM

This project uses machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict the next-day stock price movement (up/down) of Apple Inc. (AAPL). It involves downloading stock data, preprocessing, feature engineering, and building three modelsâ€”MLP (Multilayer Perceptron), Simple RNN, and LSTM. The models are evaluated using various performance metrics and ROC curves.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

- âœ… Automatically fetches 1-year of daily AAPL stock data using `yfinance`
- âœ… Removes outliers using Z-Score technique
- âœ… Scales features using Min-Max Scaling
- âœ… Creates a binary classification target: Will the price go up the next day?
- âœ… Trains and compares the following models:
  - MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)
  - Simple RNN
  - LSTM
- âœ… Evaluates models using:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix
  - ROC Curve with AUC Score
